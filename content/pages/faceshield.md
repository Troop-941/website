## We Need You!

The COVID-19 situation is changing and changing fast. As the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) is in high demand, it is very difficult for our healthcare workers to receive proper protection. We are striving to deliver thousands of PPE's for hospitals, doctors, nurses, ambulance, and dental professionals, using our 3D printers to create face shields. Some of these are local to our SF Bay Area but others are around the country too!
The effort is led by Life Scout Kai Gottschalk and is supported by fellow scouts, students, and parents from the community. Also, the biggest thanks to all of the donors who have supported the project with funds for filament, logistics expenses, and transparency sheets. There are over 50 people who have supported this in some way.

Costs of filament, transparency sheets, sheet protectors, and shipping are increasing, and your donations will help us to cover these costs that our team of 8 here in Pleasanton incur.
