      #### We Need You!


      The COVID-19 situation is changing and changing fast. As the need for
      personal protective equipment (PPE) is in high demand, it is very
      difficult for our healthcare workers to receive proper protection. We are
      striving to deliver thousands of PPE's for hospitals, doctors, nurses,
      ambulance, and dental professionals, using our 3D printers to create face
      shields. Some of these are local to our SF Bay Area but others are around
      the country too!

      The effort is led by Life Scout Kai Gottschalk and is supported by fellow
      scouts, students, and parents from the community. Also, the biggest thanks
      to all of the donors who have supported the project with funds for
      filament, logistics expenses, and transparency sheets. There are over 50
      people who have supported this in some way.


      Costs of filament, transparency sheets, sheet protectors, and shipping are
      increasing, and your donations will help us to cover these costs that our
      team of 8 here in Pleasanton incur.
