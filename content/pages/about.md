    content: "Boy Scouts of America\_**Troop 941**\_is part of the\_[Golden Gate Area Council](https://ggacbsa.org/), in the\_[Twin Valley District](http://twinvalleyscouting.com/). Our charter organization is VFW Post 6298 in Pleasanton. Troop 941 uses the model of the Boy Scouts program as Lord Baden Powell intended, structured around the patrol method and applying various methods he found useful.\n\nWe are a full uniform troop that helps Scouts work on activities in groups of 8-10 boys, which are called patrols. Our troop consists of 7 \"regular\" patrols and a leadership patrol.\_ The Scouts select new leaders (Senior Patrol Leader, Patrol Leaders) every six months through a voting process.\_ The new leadership group appoints auxiliary\_positions to aid in the troop's ability to function as a \"boy-led\" unit. The troop is active in monthly activities and outings which allow the boys to learn new skills and grow in maturity.\_ They take on increasing responsibility as they become leaders in the patrols and troops.\n\nWebelos who join our troop in the early spring\_are put into specially created\_â€œNew Scout\" patrols led by Troop Guides\_(experienced older scouts).\_\_New Scout patrols are dissolved in the fall, at\_which point\_the scouts are integrated into the\_regular patrols.\n\nMeetings take place on Zoom, due to the current pandemic. Visiting Scouts, Webelos, or Parents are welcome to attend any of our meetings. Please Contact Us to learn more.\n"
