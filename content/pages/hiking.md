      Hiking is a great way to spend your time outdoors. Itâ€™s also a good way to
      get your heart pumping for some exercise or to test your limits. Some
      hikes are just a few hundred feet while others are many miles, but all can
      pose potential hazards if not carefully considered. Take some time to
      research your destination and its terrain so you can better prepare to
      have a memorable experience and fun while exploring. Below we have
      included some resources to help you find hiking opportunities in the Bay
      Area.
